# Case Study Assignment 
## Overview and origin  

* [Blend](https://blend.com/)
* Blend was founded in 2012 by Nima Ghamsari, Erin Collard, Eugene Marinelli, and Rosco Hill. 
* The idea for Blend was inspired by founder Nima Ghamsari's personal journey. Nima immigrated to the United States from Iran when he was a young child. Nima's parents gave up their jobs and any seblance of financial security to take a chance at a better future in America. Once in the USA, Nima's parents had a hard time finding a home that they could afford and found the whole mortgage process to be very daunting. During the process of purchasing their first home, his parents were lucky enough to have a great mortgage banker. The banker was accomidating to their situation, and got them a home with only 5% down allowing them to start their ***American Dream***. This video captures [Nima's story](https://vimeo.com/288628928).
* Blend has received a total of $665M in total funding over the course of nine rounds. This includes a recent [Series G funding of $300M](https://www.protocol.com/fintech/blend-mortgage-series-g-valuation) in January 2021.</p>
## Business Activities:
* Blend seeks to improve and drastically simplify the banking process. Blend began by focusing improving the home mortgage and home equity process, but has since expanded to offer many other banking solutions including, but not limited to auto loans, personal loans, deposit accounts and credit cards. [Blend works with 287 major banks and other lenders](https://blend.com/customers/) such as BMO Harris, Wells Fargo and US Bank as well as Federal Credit unions like Affinity and Navy Federal to provide digital infastructure. By focusing on established financial institutions, Blend is able to reach a much larger customer market and get instant credibility. Blend also works with different core banking systems, data verification providers, pricing engines, customer relationship management, and document generation providers to increase overall efficiency. 
* Blend leverages integrations such as Ellie Mae Encompass, Black Knight Empower, MeridianLink LendingQB, Wipro NetOxygen, Byte, Accenture MortgageCadence, and Fiserv Mortgage Director. Blend works with several banking systems, data verification providers, pricing engines, customer relationship management, and document providers.</p>
## Landscape:
* Blend falls into the Lending, Mortgage/Real Estate, and Personal Finance domains. The initial domain that Blend sought to disrupt was the Mortgage/Real Estate domain, but they have since expanded their suite to incorporate others. 
* The trends in this domain fall in step with broader [trends in Fintech](https://djangostars.com/blog/fintech-trends/). One where Blend is a leader is in digital mortgage. Other trends are alternative lending, and digital banking. 
* Blend has [many competitors](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/best-lenders/online-mortgage-lenders/) in this space, namely Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans, Better, Floify, Guranteed Rate and AmeriSave Mortgage Co.</p>
## Results:
* Since starting in 2012, Blend has undergone tremendous growth. Their growth was jumpstarted when Quicken Loans launched Rocket Mortgage in 2015. Most other banks had to wake up to the digital revolution or lose significant volume. This led to several major banks, such as Wells Fargo, coming to [Blend for a solution](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2021/06/08/how-an-ex-semipro-poker-player-bet-big-and-won-the-43-trillion-mortgage-market/?sh=c214ff66f7c2). While financial results are not public, the recent $300M round of funding shows positive momentum for Blend.
* Because of the unique nature of Blend's platform, success cannot be measured as plainly as it can for Blend's clients. Blend can measure market penetration success by comparing the amount of digital mortgages it helps facilitate versus the competition. Additionally Blend can rate success on the amount of additional companies it partners with to expand the brand. Blend is currently partnered with 187 banks and lenders which gives them a large impact on the market. The $300M funding round, as well as a recent $3.3B valuation lend credence to this.</p>
## Recommendations:
* If I were in a position to advise Blend on what additional products or services they offer, I would suggest that they focus additional resources into their home builder program and delve into investment banking. Currently Blend has a partnership with major home builder Lennar to offer simplified digital mortgages that can close quicker than normal. Expanding to other builder groups can give Blend a significant leg up on the competition by engaging them in the mortgage process before they even get to the bank. Blend adding investement products makes sense to me considering the large uptick in retail trading on the stock markets, as well as the crypto market. 
* Blend should also investigate incorporating blockchain technology into its products. For example, capturing home titles on an non-fungible token (NFT), would decrease wait times, and increase security while reducing waste (paper, personel resources), and increase security.</p>
