## Overview and origin  

* [Blend](https://blend.com/)
* Blend was founded in 2012 by Nima Ghamsari, Erin Collard, Eugene Marinelli, and Rosco Hill. 
* The idea for Blend was inspired by founder Nima Ghamsari's personal journey. Nima immigrated to the United States from Iran when he was a young child. Nima's parents gave up their jobs and any seblance of financial security to take a chance at a better future in America. Once in the USA, Nima's parents had a hard time finding a home that they could afford and found the whole mortgage process to be very daunting. During the process of purchasing their first home, his parents were lucky enough to have a great mortgage banker. The banker was accomidating to their situation, and got them a home with only 5% down allowing them to start their ***American Dream***. This video captures [Nima's story](https://vimeo.com/288628928).
* Blend has received a total of $665M in total funding over the course of nine rounds. This includes a recent [Series G funding of $300M](https://www.protocol.com/fintech/blend-mortgage-series-g-valuation) in January 2021.</p>
